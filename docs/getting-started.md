## Let's start!

So you have installed ElkarBackup successfully. Let's connect to the web UI.

HTTP address:

```
http://<ip-address>/elkarbackup/
```

HTTPS address:

```
https://<ip-address>/
```

# Login

If it's your first time logging in, use the default credential:

```
username: root
password: root
```

Obviously, you should change the password immediately!
