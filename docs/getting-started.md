## Let's start!

So you have installed ElkarBackup successfully. Let's connect to the web UI.

### Debian/Ubuntu:

Apache will be configured to access in two ways:

HTTP address:

```
http://ELKARBACKUP_SERVER/elkarbackup/
```

HTTPS address:

```
https://ELKARBACKUP_SERVER/
```

### Docker container:

If you are using the default `docker-compose.yml` template, you can access to the following URL:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

# Login

If it's your first time logging in, use the default credential:

```
username: root
password: root
```

Obviously, you should change the password immediately!!
