In our networks we have different types of information, and having to have backup copies of all these data does not mean that we should give everyone the same treatment.

In some cases the information should be kept for a long time \(months or years\), and in other cases after a week the data will not be valid and we would like to delete them.

On the other hand, for one type of data will be enough to make a copy at night, and for others we would like to have 3 copies scheduled during the day.

We can create different policies for different needs, and then it will be enough to apply the appropriate policy to each _**job**_.

It is important to understand that the different tasks of a Client can be programmed with different policies, since the_** policies are linked with jobs**_, not with clients.
