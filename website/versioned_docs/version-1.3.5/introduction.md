Elkarbackup provides easy to configure and powerful open source filesystem backup solution. It was developed to make the management of our backups easier, regardless of the operating system of the client machine.

ElkarBackup is a free open-source software (under the terms of [GPL V3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)) and it's based on other open source technologies:

* [RSnapshot](http://rsnapshot.org)
* [RSync](https://rsync.samba.org)
* [PHP](http://php.net)
* [Symfony](http://www.symfony.com)

## Features

* Centralized backups.
* Backup of GNU/Linux and Windows computers.
* Minimal disk usage because of the use of hardlinks, but having the option to recover the whole backup with a mouse click.
* Easy-to-use and multilingual web interface.
* Instant recovery

To achieve its magic, Elkarbackup stands on the shoulders of [RSnapshot](http://rsnapshot.org), a fantastic command-line backup tool.
